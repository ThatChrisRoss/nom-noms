1. Bring water and milk to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Stir
   in macaroni and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until macaroni is soft (slightly past al dente), 6 to 8 minutes. Add
   American cheese, mustard, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly,
   until cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute. OFF HEAT, stir in
   Gruyère and blue cheese until evenly distributed but not melted.
   Cover saucepan and let sit for 5 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, combine panko, oil, salt, and pepper in 8-inch nonstick
   skillet until panko is evenly moistened. Cook over medium heat,
   stirring frequently, until evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Off heat,
   sprinkle Parmesan over panko mixture and stir to combine. Transfer
   panko mixture to small bowl.

3. Stir macaroni until sauce is smooth (sauce may look loose but will
   thicken as it cools). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer
   to warm serving dish and sprinkle panko mixture over top.
4. Top with any EXTRA TOPPINGS that sound good to you and serve
   immediately.
