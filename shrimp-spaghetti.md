### Note

Be sure to use the 3 quarts of water specified in the recipe for cooking the pasta. The starch that the pasta releases
into the water is essential to achieving the proper consistency in the sauce.

## Instructions

Remove shells and tails from shrimp and set aside. Pat shrimp dry with a paper towl and season with salt and pepper. Cut
shrimp into 1/2 or 1/3 pieces depending on the size of shrimp.

Heat oil and shrimp shells/tails in small saucepan over medium heat until shrimp shells are crispy and fragrant, about
10 minutes. Strain oil and remove shells and discard. Reduce heat to medium-low and saute garlic until golden brown and
fragrant, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in pepper flakes and parsley. Set aside.

Meanwhile, bring 3 quarts water to boil in large Dutch oven. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon coarse ground sea salt and cook,
stirring often, until strands are flexible but still very firm in center, about 8 minutes. RESERVE 3 cups cooking water,
then drain pasta.

Combine pasta, oil mixture, ½teaspoon salt, shrimp pieces, and 2 cups reserved cooking water in now-empty pot and bring
to boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often with tongs and folding pasta over itself, until water is mostly
absorbed but still pools slightly in bottom of pot, about 5 minutes.

Let pasta sit off heat for 2 minutes. Stir in additional reserved cooking water as needed (approximately ¼ cup) to
adjust consistency (noodles should be slightly wet, not oily). Season with salt and pepper and top with freshly grated
Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve.
